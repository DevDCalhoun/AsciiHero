Hello adventurer. Quest Hunter they call you, correct? I have an offer to make you. Me and my associates are
working on a very important project, and the nearby village Quest Hunters and the village elder have been 
snooping into our affairs. We will pay you very well if you get them off of our backs. 
Do this for us and
we will see about working together further. Now, leave my presence.

Well, well, well... There is more to you than I first thought. Me and my associates are planning a ritual that
will bring us great power. However, we must procure all the necessary materials to complete it, and some of these
materials can only be found on the priests of the village nearby. If you can retrieve what we need and take care
of the other meddling men in the caves and forests nearby then we will allow you to participate in the ritual with
us and gain some power of your own.

The ritual is happening tonight. The power that the dark god will grant us will be great. There is one slight
issue though. The village Quest Hunters and the militia are planning an attack on us. 
I have some spies that
have supplied us with this information. You will be at the fore-front of our defense. Keep them busy long enough
to allow us to complete the ritual, then we will destroy them all with our new-found power.
