Hello Quest Hunter. I am glad to see your training is complete. 
The nearby village is having issues with roaming
creatures in the local caves and forests. 
This is what your training has been for. Help us clear the nearby areas
of these monsters and we will see about giving you a more important role in the village.

Thank you for your service in the previous task. The villagers are able to gather resources from the caves and
forests safely. 
There is something of concern that has happened though. The villagers have been talking of
cultists in the area. They mostly come out at night and perform dark rituals. What they are doing I am not sure,
but I know that it cannot be good. Please investigate and see what you can find out.

You have done much for this village. 
But things are getting worse with the cult group by the village. They seem
to be serving a dark god and are trying to summon him to improve their powers and possibly destroy the village.
Please stop them from doing this before it is too late. If you are too late, you may be in for a fight. Prepare
yourself before approaching them.
